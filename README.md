# FitzHugh-Nagumo Spiral Wave Tracking: A Methods Comparison

Compare and Contrast the Contour and Phase Identification Methods for Spiral Wave Identification using the FitzHugh-Nagumo Model

## Code instructions

All togglable variables and adjustable parameters are located in the `main.cpp` file, you will want to adjust variables before compilation

Highlights:

- SimConstraints simulation.last_time: Tells the simulation how many milliseconds to run for
- SimConstraints simulation.spiral: If true the simulation will apply a stimulous at the time specifiec by SimConstraints simulation.spiral_time in order to create a singular spiral wave
- SimConstraints simulation.tip_track_JDM: If true, the program will track the approximate location of the spiral wave tip using the Jacobian Determinate Method
- SimConstraints simulation.tip_track_volt: If true, the program will track the approximate location of the spiral wave tip based on the estimated value of the spiral wave tip in phase space currently stored in Parameters params.utip_pick and Parameters params.vtip_pick.
- SimConstraints simulation.tip_track_JDM: If true, the program will track the approximate location of the spiral wave tip on the estimated value phase angle of the wave about the point Parameters params.utip_pick and Parameters params.vtip_pick.
- SimConstraints.run_name: Stores the title of your simulation, your output files will be stored in a file sharing this name

## Output Files

This code outputs .bin files for the u and v state values of the FitzHugh-Nagumo Model accross the simulated region every 100ms. If tip-tracking of any kind is toggled to true there is an additional output of the x and y locations of the tip within the region, NAN values in this file are reported as x=-1 and y=-1. Included in this repository are two python codes used to visualize the results. `EvolvingPlot.py` gerenates a .gif file of the simulation which shows the evoluution of the wave in the simulated region. `TipTrajectory.py` reads the outputs containing the (x,y) coordinates of the spiral wave tip and then plots the results on a grid. Both python files need to have the same dimension variable values as the simulation in order to function properly. Each file is designed to be run in terminal in the `ResultingVisuals` directory using the command `python <filename>.py`.  They will each create their figures in the `Figures` folder in the main directory.

## Compilation instructions

**Both compilation options require CUDA and a GPU**

**Preferred Compilation**

If you have ncvv installed run the following command in the repository directory:
```
nvcc main.cpp CUDAfiles/ComputeFHN.cu PreCompiledHeader/FHNpch.cpp -o fhnModel.exe
```
**-OR-**

**Backup Compilation**

Run the following commands in the `CMakeLocalBuild` directory:
 ```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
 
The `fhnModel.exe` file will then be in a subfolder entitled `build/run/`

## Running the Code

This code is designed to be run on the Georgia Tech PACE cluster, but can be run on any computer with a NVIDIA GPU and CUDA installed. To run locally, either open the constructed `fhnModel.exe` file or use your terminal to run the program by navigating to the `fhnModel.exe` and run either the `start fhnModel.exe` command (Windows) or the `wine fhnModel.exe` command (Linux and macOS).
